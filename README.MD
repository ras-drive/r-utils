## What is the purpose of this repo?
I'm mostly writing this as practice to get more used
to writing rust code but I also thought it was a fun
way to get more into OS development by starting the
development of a custom userspace! I chose to use the
GPL license over CoreUtils MIT license because this
project was heavily inspired by the GNU Utils and I
fully believe that these utilites should be free for
everyone and as such has no need for commercial use.
If anyone would like to contribute this is mostly for
fun but if enough are built up I would love to start
replacing parts of my system with these and maybe even
one day have my own custom Linux userspace to pair with
the kernel(I know this is obviously a massive ways off)!
